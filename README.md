# Internship Progress – Week 2

## Learning FastAPI, Pydantic, SOLID Principles & Docker (Backend Fundamentals)

---

## Overview

During the second week of my internship, I focused on backend fundamentals along with understanding basic software design principles. I was asked to learn **FastAPI** for building backend APIs, **Pydantic** for request and response validation, and the core concepts of **SOLID principles** to understand how clean and maintainable software is designed. In addition to this, I dockerized the application to understand deployment basics.

To apply these concepts practically, I worked on an **insurance premium category prediction API**, which takes user details as input and returns a predicted insurance category.

## Tasks Assigned

- Learn the basics of **FastAPI**
- Understand the core concepts of **SOLID principles**
- Create a simple API using FastAPI
- Design request and response schemas
- Dockerize the FastAPI application
- Understand basic backend deployment workflow

---

## What I Worked On

### Understanding SOLID Principles
Before starting API development, I was asked to learn the basics of **SOLID principles**. This helped me understand how software should be designed to be clean, maintainable, and scalable. I learned the purpose of each principle at a conceptual level and how following them improves code structure and readability.

As part of this, I also learned about the **Singleton design pattern**, which ensures that only a single instance of a class is created and shared across the application. This helped me understand how shared resources or configurations can be managed efficiently in backend systems.

---

### FastAPI Basics
I learned how backend APIs are developed using FastAPI and gained understanding of:
- Creating API endpoints using GET and POST methods
- Structuring APIs with routes like home, health check, and prediction
- Using FastAPI’s interactive documentation for testing APIs
- Understanding request–response flow in backend services

This helped me build a strong foundation in modern Python-based backend development.

---

### Pydantic for Data Validation
Along with FastAPI, I learned how **Pydantic** ensures clean and validated data.

Key learnings:
- Defining structured input and output schemas
- Automatic validation of incoming request data
- Clear error responses for invalid inputs
- Maintaining reliable and consistent API contracts

This gave me clarity on how real-world APIs handle user inputs safely.

---

### Insurance Premium Category Prediction (Use Case)
To make learning more practical, I worked on an insurance-related use case.

The API:
- Accepts user health, lifestyle, and demographic information
- Processes the data through backend logic
- Returns a predicted insurance premium category

This helped me understand how backend APIs connect users with prediction logic.

---

### Dockerizing the Application 
In the final phase of the week, I dockerized the FastAPI application.

Through this, I learned:
- Why Docker is important for consistent environments
- How containerization simplifies deployment
- How backend services can run independently of system configurations

This gave me a clear understanding of how applications move from development to deployment.

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained an understanding of **SOLID principles** and clean code concepts
- Learned the basics of the **Singleton design pattern**
- Backend API development using **FastAPI**
- Data validation using **Pydantic**
- Building a real-world insurance prediction API
- Containerizing applications using **Docker**

---

## Summary

Week 2 focused on strengthening both backend development and software design fundamentals. By learning SOLID principles alongside FastAPI, Pydantic, and Docker, I gained a better understanding of how clean, reliable, and deployable backend systems are designed and implemented in real-world projects.
